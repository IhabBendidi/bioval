- Add pytorch and pytorch lightning integration tests
- ajouter le distribu√© - Now
- merge with Interclass metric - Now
- Merge with part about control compound - Now
- Find api for using cell profiler on test when asked by user
- Revamp library to be fully compatible with torchmetrics too (Maybe? maybe not necessary)
- Test metrics with different code design, to see most adaapted for usage in pytorch and PL
- possibility to use the metric as a callback in PL
- possibility to use the metric on a data subset only
- Multiprocessing? both cpu and gpu. It should be both adaptive to pytorch and PL multiprocessing, or do multiprocessing for acceleration on its own

- Add wiki files that explain usage and eaxmples and docs of the code
- Automate github actions to test automatically the code in containers after each push
